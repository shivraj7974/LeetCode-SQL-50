There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

select t1.machine_id , round(avg(t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp),3) AS processing_time from activity t1 join activity t2
on t1.machine_id = t2.machine_id
and t1.process_id = t2.process_id
and t1.activity_type = 'start'
and t2.activity_type = 'end'
group by t1.machine_id ;


ROUND(..., 3):

Rounds the calculated average processing time to 3 decimal places for clarity.
